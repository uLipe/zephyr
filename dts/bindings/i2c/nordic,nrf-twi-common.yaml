        The SDA pin to use. The value is "<&gpioX Y flags>".
        Pin PX.Y will be used for SDA. The "flags" portion currently
        has no effect, but must be set to zero.

        For example, to use P0.16 for SDA, set:

          sda-gpios = <&gpio0 16 0>;

        To use P1.2 for SDA, set:

          sda-gpios = <&gpio1 2 0>;

        The SCL pin to use. The value should be set in the same
        way as the sda-gpios property.

    sda-pin:

        The SDA pin to use.

        For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
        to use P0.16 for SDA, set:

            sda-pin = <16>;

        For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
        example, to use P1.2 for SDA, set:

            sda-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

    scl-pin:
      type: int
      required: false
      deprecated: true
      description: |
        Deprecated; use scl-gpios instead.

        The SCL pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as
        the sda-pin property's.
